Add a new field to your user profile admin to add in your Twitter Username.

== Description ==

Designed for multi author blogs, but useful for single author sites too, this gives you a new box in your profile admin to add in your
Twitter username. You can then automatically have this displayed after each of your posts or control where it is displayed. For a
multi-author site this means each post author can have their twitter account linked to automatically.

Installation Instructions:

1. Download the plugin and unzip it.
2. Put the twitter-user folder into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' next to Twitter User.
4. Go to the Options > Twitter User and configure your options.
5. Go to your Profile and at the bottom of the page is a new box called Twitter User. Add your username in there.
6. If you choose to add the function manually to your theme file(s) then use

display_twitter();
